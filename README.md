# Sudoku
Sudoku in C, C++ for Linux systems.
This program is only a project that shows how to work in a enviroment with limitated tools.
It's not optimized.I will probably continue it later.
If you want to start in windows you should have to change some instructions:
fflush->__fpurge;
system(clear)->system(cls);
